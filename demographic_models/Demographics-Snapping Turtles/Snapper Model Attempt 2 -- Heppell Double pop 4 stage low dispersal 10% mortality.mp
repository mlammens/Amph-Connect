Snapper Model Attempt 2 -- Heppell Double pop 4 stage low dispersal 5% mortality
This attempt will show 2 populations of snapping turtles with low dispersal rates due to habitat fragmentation, and 5% more mortality than the previous models.
The data was collected from the article by Selina S. Heppell. 
Reduction in survival reflects the 5% increase in mortality. Dispersal was reduced from 50% to 1%.
